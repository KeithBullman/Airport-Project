Year 2 - Semester 1
Date: 27th November 2019

Specification:

Develop a basic application in a general purpose procedural language (Java) that uses a DBMS (MySQL) to store data.
You must investigate, organise and implement all technical aspects of the Application Design (called a tiered architecture e.g. client-server is minimum 2 tiers), Database Design involving ER Modelling and Normalization and building a Java interface to the Database Application.  
You are to build an application system for the application area of A Flight Booking System.  It is up you the student to determine how this system will operate and to design a database that will support its operation.
   
The project will run over a number of weeks, thus some marks will be assigned to project management. As manager/supervisor, I require the following:
•	Well managed time allocation to solve the problem i.e. you should devise and communicate a plan of action with progress updates so that at each stage I can be confident that the project will be completed on time i.e. not crammed at the end. Note, you could opt for weekly plan, with reviews in lab; you need to devise an alternative if you opt not for this approach.
•	List of references where you sourced code/explanations of concepts.
•	Reporting of problems, and potential problems, in a timely manner.
•	Verifiable work by you. If you turn up at labs each week and have your work reviewed then that is one way to do this; however, if you wish to work ‘outside’ of class/lab times, then you need some other approach.

Minimum requirement is therefore, a plan (with stages/milestones) and an activity log. Each log entry must be dated. Each milestone must be reviewed.

Final hand-up/deliverable 
1.	Hard Copy Print off of all the documentation: well organised (e.g. index, page numbers, etc.) required.
a.	Your firstname, Surname, Student Number, Class (e.g. SDH2) 
b.	project description, 
c.	technical issues dealt with, 
d.	database design
e.	application design 
f.	plan/log: neatness etc required, 
g.	conclusions/review
h.	references
2.	A Hard Copy print off of the final code (maybe add as an appendix to the project Documentation)
a.	Code to include data I/O to DBMS: SQL insert, update, select.
3.	Sign off of own work (see sample below) 
4.	You will also be required to submit a zipped copy of codebase (NetBeans, Eclipse, etc.) with instructions on Blackboard.
5.	A demo of the working code in week 11 within your lab slot.
